# Web Accessibility Checker

## Overview
This tool helps identify accessibility issues in web content by analyzing HTML code against WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. It provides feedback about potential barriers that might prevent people with disabilities from using your website effectively.

## Who Is This For?
- Content creators
- Web editors
- Quality assurance testers
- Anyone who needs to check web content for accessibility compliance

## How to Use

### 1. Basic Usage
1. Copy your HTML code
2. Paste it into the textarea
3. Click "Check Accessibility"
4. Review the results

### 2. Understanding Results

The checker shows four categories:
- **Violations**: Critical issues that must be fixed
- **Needs Review**: Issues that require human judgment
- **Passed**: Elements that meet accessibility standards
- **Not Applicable**: Rules that don't apply to your content

### 3. Test Cases

#### Good Example: Product Filter Interface
```html
<div role="search">
    <label for="price">Price:</label>
    <input type="number" id="price" name="price">
</div>
```
This passes accessibility checks because it:
- Has proper labels for inputs
- Uses semantic HTML
- Includes ARIA roles
- Has clear structure

#### Common Issues Example:
```html
<div>
    <input type="number" placeholder="Price">
</div>
```
This fails because it:
- Lacks proper labels
- Relies on placeholder text
- Missing semantic structure
- No ARIA roles

## Common Issues and How to Fix Them

1. **Missing Image Descriptions**
   - ❌ `<img src="logo.png">`
   - ✅ `<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">`

2. **Unclear Links**
   - ❌ `<a href="#">Click here</a>`
   - ✅ `<a href="#">View product details</a>`

3. **Missing Form Labels**
   - ❌ `<input type="text">`
   - ✅ `<label for="name">Name:</label><input type="text" id="name">`

4. **Poor Heading Structure**
   - ❌ Using `<div>` with large text
   - ✅ Using proper heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.)

## Best Practices for Testing

1. **Test Common Elements**
   - Forms and inputs
   - Images and media
   - Navigation menus
   - Buttons and links
   - Tables and data presentation

2. **Check Interactive Features**
   - Form validation messages
   - Error notifications
   - Status updates
   - Modal dialogs
   - Dropdown menus

3. **Review Text Content**
   - Heading structure
   - Link text clarity
   - Error messages
   - Instructions and labels

## Example Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Contact Form
Test a basic contact form to ensure:
- All fields have labels
- Required fields are marked
- Error messages are clear
- Submit button is properly labeled

### Scenario 2: Product Listing
Check a product listing page for:
- Product images have alt text
- Prices are properly labeled
- Action buttons are clear
- Sort/filter controls are accessible

## Tips for Better Results

1. Use semantic HTML whenever possible
2. Provide text alternatives for images
3. Use proper heading structure
4. Label all form controls
5. Ensure sufficient color contrast
6. Make interactive elements keyboard-accessible
7. Provide clear error messages
8. Use ARIA labels when needed
